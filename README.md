# Conversion Chart

## Flour

1For all altitudes, add up to 2 tablespoons of flour per cup.

## Leavening Agents

The gases in leavening agents, such as baking soda and baking powder, expand faster at higher altitudes, so that is one part of a recipe that will most often need to change. Since they expand faster, you will need a little less. Plus, itâ€™s a good place to start when making adjustments to the recipes! 

If the altitude is:

3,500-6,500 feet: For each teaspoon, decrease by 1/8 of a teaspoon.

6,500-8,500 feet: For each teaspoon, decrease by 1/8-1/4 of a teaspoon.

8,500-10,000 feet: For each teaspoon, decrease by 1/4 of a teaspoon.

## Sugar

The concentration of sugar is increased because of the increased evaporation which can affect the structure of your baked goods.

If the altitude is:

3,500-6,500 feet: Reduce sugar by up to 1 tablespoon.

6,500-8,500 feet: Reduce sugar by up to 2 tablespoons.

8,500-10,000 feet: Reduce sugar by 1-3 tablespoons.

## Liquid

You need extra liquid in the recipes you are baking at a higher altitude to keep them from drying out. Remember, extra-large eggs count as extra liquid.

If the altitude is:

3,500-6,500 feet: Increase liquid by 1-2 tablespoons.

6,500-8,500 feet: Increase liquid by 2-4 tablespoons.

8,500-10,000 feet: Increase liquid by 3-4 tablespoons.

## Cookies
Cookies are the least affected by high altitude, but there are still a couple of tweaks you can make to bake up your favorite batch of cookies. Slightly decrease the amount of baking soda or baking powder. You could also decrease the fat or sugar or increase the amount of liquid.

One final adaptation would be to increase the oven temperature, but be sure to watch the cookies as the baking time will decrease.

Note: Stick to regular cookie sheets and not double-layered or insulated.
