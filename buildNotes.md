    If yeast was adjusted...
"Yeast is a key ingredient in baking that causes dough to rise, as it ferments the sugars in the dough, producing carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide gets trapped in the dough, causing it to expand and rise.

However, at higher altitudes, the air pressure is lower. This affects baking in a couple of ways:

Dough rises more quickly: Because the air pressure is lower, the gases produced by yeast fermentation have less resistance and thus expand more quickly. This means that dough can rise and expand much faster than it would at lower altitudes. If not adjusted, this could lead to over-proofed dough that collapses, resulting in a denser and less appealing bread.

Liquid evaporates faster: Lower air pressure also means that liquids in the dough will evaporate and boil at a lower temperature. This can cause the dough to dry out more quickly, which could potentially impact the activity of the yeast.

To adjust for these factors, the amount of yeast in the recipe has been adjusted. The amount of liquid will be adjusted as well to account for faster evaporation."
